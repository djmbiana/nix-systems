my personal dot files of my nix-os systems

# why nix?
- because i wanted to experiment with the reproducibility of it. i aim to deploy this on multiple machines. ontop of that, i like the fact each generation is saved automatically.

|   | Programs |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| shell  | zsh + oh-my-zsh  |
| editor  | doom emacs  |
| terminal | foot |
| wm | hyprland + waybar (no animations cause i hate fun) |
| os | nix-os (unfortunately.) |
